# User Testing

For our user testing we asked two people to test our system. The first user was a friend that is a pre-med student with a general 
knowledge of technology. The second user was a roommate with a bachelor’s degree in accounting and a basic understanding of technology. 
The design of the test consisted of first explaining what the function of the application was followed by allowing the user to explore 
the application on their own. Users were asked how many pages were on the app, if any pages were hard to find, if there was a general 
template to the web application, what the components consisted of, if the links on all pages were functional, if a loading screen appeared 
on the chart page, to describe what the chart shows before explanation, to fill out the form on the main page, to describe what happened 
after submitting the form, if the application performed the functionality as described, and if the application was easy to navigate and 
understand. During the user tests, the users were both confused about the form on the main page. The users needed to be prompted to 
click on the map to get the markers for the latitude and longitude coordinates. One user was unsure of what to do after filling out 
the form because the submit button was out of view and the map appears to be at the end of the page. The user asked if he should press
‘ENTER’ to submit the form. He was prompted to scroll down and press the submit button. The users explored the rest of the web application
and found the other pages to be straightforward with their content. 

From these user tests, we learned that our application has an intriguing functionality and one user described it as “cool”. We also 
learned that the layout of the form does not suggest how it should be used. The form should include an instruction to click the map 
to get the latitude and longitude coordinates. The map should also be resized to be taller and not quite as wide so that users find 
it easier to use. One user mentioned moving the map to one side with the rest of the form on the other side to make it more appealing
and less “awkward”. The same user mentioned that the form had some weird spacing that could be fixed. Moving the map would also move 
the submit button to be closer to the form fields and easily located. A user mentioned that implementing a color or small image 
coordination between the markers on the map and the latitude and longitude detail would be helpful. Lastly, we learned that the chart
on a separate page seems inconvenient if the data from the chart is related to the data selected from the form on the main page. The 
chart also shows two dates, one in the middle of the chart and one along the axis. From doing this user evaluation, we learned that 
our web application contains some details that may seem obvious to us as developers but are not to our users. 

As a result of these user evaluations, there are a few things that we will change. Such changes include, adding some instruction on 
the main form to guide users as they are filling in the data, changing the size of the map to be taller and not as wide, and changing
the layout of the main form to be more appealing and easier to user. The chart may be moved to the main page to provide instant
feedback of the data selected; however, further development may prove that this is unnecessary because of other instant feedback
provided. The other instant feedback provided will show the data selected instantly after submitting the form, then the user will 
have the option to see the data shown in the chart if they choose.
