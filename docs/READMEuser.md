## Introduction
The Customized Online Aggregation and Summarization Tool for Environmental Rasters (<a href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=26321">COASTER</a>) system was developed by the YellowStone Ecological Research Center (<a href="https://www.yellowstoneresearch.org/">YERC</a>) in response to the information needs of end-user communities interested in decision-support for natural resource management. The purpose of COASTER is to greatly simplify the process of creating predictor datasets for research exploring environmental impacts driven by climate change, land-use activities, disturbances (fire, flooding, etc) as well as invasive spread such as spine beetle infestations.

## Overview of Project
The project consists of rearchitecting the COASTER system. Since it is still in early development, there are many paths we can take to improve the system. We can either: 
* concentrate on rearchitecting the database and how data is stored and processed
* Expand the current datasets by integrating new public datasets to the COASTER system
* Revamping the front-end interface of COASTER

## Project Goals
Due to the time length of this project, we have decided to expand the current datasets of COASTER and create a prototype user interface on how we would access this data. (Project Goals may change overtime). 

## Current Features
None yet, we are on our zero-feature release. We look forward to adding much more to this section.
